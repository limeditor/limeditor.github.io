We want to bring you an Open Source text editor with great capabilities, as a successor
to Sublime Text.

We use Jekyll as a static site generator fully integrated into GitHub Pages. Feel free to
contribute!  
Check out [Jekyll docs] for more info on how to get the most out of it.

See you on our [GitHub repository][Lime]!
