Since Lime Text is gradually converging towards more stable releases (binaries?),
I thought I would have a shot at improving its website so that it gains more
visibility.

So here it is! I cleaned up the existing code and dropped some existing dependency
burden.  
The actual website is now simpler to develop on and depends on Bootstrap v3.1.1,
providing reference-class responsivity.

It was also the occasion to bring up a new lime logo, courtesy of Gerald G. from
OpenClipart.org.

Enjoy, and don't forget to contribute [on GitHub]!
